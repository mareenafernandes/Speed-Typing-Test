# Speed-Typing-Test
Problem Statement: 
In this Python project, I have built an exciting project through which one can check and even improve their typing speed. For a graphical UI, I used the pygame library which is utilized for working with illustrations. Like-  
1. This project requires some knowledge on topics like Python, and some python libraries pygame, etc. 
2. Python - Python is easy to learn and work on with the language. It is an elevated level, broadly useful programming and profoundly intruded on language. 
3. Pygame - Pygame library is an open-source module for the Python programming language explicitly proposed to assist you with making games and other mixed media applications. Based on the profoundly versatile SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) improvement library, pygame can stumble into numerous stages and working frameworks. 

Functionalities supported by this project:  
1. The draw_text() technique for Game class is a helper function work that will draw the content on the screen. 
2. The get_sentence() technique will open up the file and return an irregular sentence from the rundown. We split the entire string with a newline character. 
3. The show_results() technique is where we calculate the speed of the user’s typing. The time begins when the user clicks on the input box and when the user hits the return key "Enter" at that point we play out the distinction and calculate time in seconds. 
4. The run() method-This is the primary strategy for our group that will deal with all the events/occasions. 
5. We call the reset_game() strategy at the beginning of this technique which resets all the variables. The reset_game() method resets all variables so we can begin testing our typing speed again. 

Software Requirement:  
1. Programming language – Python. 
2. Operating System – Windows/Linux. 

Hardware Requirement: Nothing specific.
